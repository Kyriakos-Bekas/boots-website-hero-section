# Hero Section Animation with GSAP

## Project Overview

This is the hero section of an Autumn Boots Collection landing page.

Each part of the section animates beautifully, both providing a nice experience and drawing the attention to the Call-To-Action button.

## Code Structure

For this project I used HTML, CSS and Javascript, with the help of GSAP.

### HTML

Correct use of semantic HTML5 elements, that signify the role that each piece has on the page.

### CSS

Organised CSS rules, without code repetition and well-placed media queries. The project is **responsive**.

### Javascript

Each step of setting up the animation is carefully explained with comments.
